# # Python Fundamentals
# 
# In this section, we begin with the basics.
# 
# We will talk about what a programming language is and how computers use
# them to perform operations.
# 
# We discuss why we chose the Python language for this course.
# 
# We learn about core concepts like variables, data-types, and
# functions.
# 
# We will become familiar with the core data-types built into Python,
# some standard functions we will frequently use, and learn how to define our own functions.
# 
# By the end, you should have a solid grasp on core Python
# concepts, be prepared to study the next sections on numerical programming,
# and feel comfortable handling data.

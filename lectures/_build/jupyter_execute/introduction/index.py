# # Introduction
# 
# In this section, we set the stage for the rest of the course.
# 
# We will describe our goals and objectives.
# 
# We will then talk about what a programming language is, how computers use them to do operations, and
# why we have chosen the Python language.
# 
# We then present two potential environments for working through this course material:
# 
# 1. A cloud environment in which computations are performed remotely on the cloud and you interact
#    with this remote computer through your browser.
# 1. A local environment in which you install the appropriate software and all interactions are with
#    your own computer.
# 
# At the end of this section, we hope you understand what you'd like to accomplish with these lectures
# and that you are able to start and use a Jupyter notebook.

    "approach below. {cite}`het-athey2016b` and {cite}`het-wager2018` are\n",
    "alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generic Machine Learning Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will describe the \"generic machine learning\n",
    "inference\" method of {cite}`het-cddf2018` to explore heterogeneity in\n",
    "conditional average treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows any\n",
    "machine learning method to be used to estimate $E[y_i(1) -\n",
    "y_i(0) |X_i=x]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference for functions estimated by machine learning methods is\n",
    "typically either impossible or requires very restrictive assumptions.\n",
    "{cite}`het-cddf2018` gets around this problem by focusing on inference for\n",
    "certain summary statistics of the machine learning prediction for\n",
    "$E[y_i(1) - y_i(0) |X_i=x]$ rather than\n",
    "$E[y_i(1) - y_i(0) |X_i=x]$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Linear Projection of CATE\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $s_0(x) = E[y_i(1) - y_i(0) |X_i=x]$ denote the true\n",
    "conditional average treatment effect. Let $S(x)$ be an estimate\n",
    "or noisy proxy for $s_0(x)$. One way to summarize how well\n",
    "$S(x)$ approximates $s_0(x)$ is to look at the best linear\n",
    "projection of $s_0(x)$ on $S(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\argmin}{arg\\,min}\n",
    "\\beta_0, \\beta_1 = \\argmin_{b_0,b_1} E[(s_0(x) -\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Showing that $\\beta_0 = E[y_i(1) - y_i(0)]$\n",
    "is the unconditional average treatment effect is not difficult. More interestingly,\n",
    "$\\beta_1$ is related to how well $S(x)$ approximates\n",
    "$s_0(x)$. If $S(x) = s_0(x)$, then $\\beta_1=1$. If\n",
    "$S(x)$ is completely uncorrelated with $s_0(x)$, then\n",
    "$\\beta_1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best linear projection of the conditional average treatment\n",
    "effect tells us something about how well $S(x)$ approximates\n",
    "$s_0(x)$, but does not directly quantify how much the conditional\n",
    "average treatment effect varies with $x$. We could try looking\n",
    "at $S(x)$ directly, but if $x$ is high dimensional, reporting or visualizing\n",
    "$S(x)$ will be difficult. Moreover, most\n",
    "machine learning methods have no satisfactory method to determine inferences\n",
    "on $S(x)$. This is very problematic if we want to use\n",
    "$S(x)$ to shape future policy decisions. For example, we might\n",
    "want to use $S(x)$ to target the treatment to people with\n",
    "different $x$. If we do this, we need to know whether the\n",
    "estimated differences across $x$ in $S(x)$ are precise or\n",
    "caused by noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grouped Average Treatment Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with both these issues, {cite}`het-cddf2018` focuses on\n",
    "grouped average treatment effects (GATE) with groups defined by\n",
    "$S(x)$. Partition the data into a fixed, finite number of groups\n",
    "based on $S(x)$ . Let\n",
    "$G_{k}(x) = 1\\{\\ell_{k-1} \\leq S(x) \\leq \\ell_k \\}$ where\n",
    "$\\ell_k$ could be a constant chosen by the researcher or evenly\n",
    "spaced quantiles of $S(x)$. The $k$ th grouped average\n",
    "treatment effect is then $\\gamma_k = E[y(1) - y(0) | G_k(x)]$.\n",
    "If the true $s_0(x)$ is not constant, and $S(x)$\n",
    "approximates $s_0(x)$ well, then the grouped average treatment\n",
    "effects will increase with $k$. If the conditional average treatment effect\n",
    "has no heterogeneity (i.e. $s_0(x)$ is constant) and/or\n",
    "$S(x)$ is a poor approximation to $s_0(x)$,\n",
    "then the grouped average treatment effect will tend to\n",
    "be constant with $k$ and may even be non-monotonic due to\n",
    "estimation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate both the best linear projection of the conditional average treatment\n",
    "effect and the grouped treatment effects by using\n",
    "particular regressions. Let $B(x)$ be an estimate of the outcome\n",
    "conditional on no treatment, i.e. $B(x) = \\widehat{E[y(0)|x]}$\n",

    "From this, we see that the group predicted to be most affected by treatment\n",
    "are less educated, less likely to own a TV or\n",
    "motorbike, and more likely to participate in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to maximize the program impact with a limited budget, targeting the program towards\n",
    "less educated and less wealthy mothers could be a good idea. The existing financial incentive\n",
    "already does this to some extent. As one might expect, a fixed-size\n",
    "cash incentive has a bigger behavioral impact on less wealthy\n",
    "individuals. If we want to further target these individuals, we\n",

    "\n",
    "### Caution\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring treatment heterogeneity like above, we need to\n",
    "interpret our results carefully. In particular, looking at grouped\n",
    "treatment effects and covariate means conditional on group leads to\n",
    "many hypothesis tests (although we never stated null hypotheses or\n",
    "reported p-values, the inevitable eye-balling of differences in the\n",
    "above graphs compared to their confidence intervals has the same\n",
    "issues as formal hypothesis tests).  When we perform many hypothesis\n",
    "tests, we will likely stumble upon some statistically\n",
    "significant differences by chance. Therefore, writing about a single large difference found in the\n",
    "above analysis as though it is our main\n",
    "finding would be misleading (and perhaps unethical). The correct thing to do is to present all\n",
    "results that we have looked at.  See [this excellent news article](https://slate.com/technology/2013/07/statistics-and-psychology-multiple-comparisons-give-spurious-results.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Causal Trees and Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite}`het-athey2016b` develop the idea of \"causal trees.\" The purpose and\n",
    "method are qualitatively similar to the grouped average treatment\n",
    "effects. The main difference is that the groups in {cite}`het-athey2016b`\n",
    "are determined by a low-depth regression tree instead of by quantiles\n",
    "of a noisy estimate of the conditional average treatment effect. As\n",
    "above, sample-splitting is used to facilitate inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal trees share many downsides of regression trees. In\n",
    "particular, the branches of the tree and subsequent results can be\n",
    "sensitive to small changes in the data.  {cite}`het-wager2018` develop a\n",
    "causal forest estimator to address this concern. This causal forest\n",
    "estimates $E[y_i(1) - y_i(0) |X_i=x]$ directly. Unlike most\n",
    "machine learning estimators, {cite}`het-wager2018` prove that causal\n",
    "forests are consistent and pointwise asymptotically normal, albeit\n",
    "with a slower than $\\sqrt{n}$ rate of convergence. In practice,\n",
    "this means that either the sample size must be very large (and/or $x$\n",
    "relatively low dimension) to get precise estimates.\n",
